    "* Suppose that there exists a continuous function f(x) where x is the frequency from a set of real numbers $x\\in \\mathbb{R}$.\n",
    "* Call the set of points at which the machine measures the value of $f(x): x \\in KFx \\subset \\mathbb{R}$ where $KFx= KnowFx= {x_0, ....,x_N}$ a discrete set of known data points.\n",
    "* We only know the value of $f(x): x \\in KFx$ (the frequency point measured by the machine),\n",
    "  so there will be a lot of unknown values $f(\\hat{x}): \\hat{x} \\in uKFx$ with $uKFx = UnknownFx = \\mathbb{R} \\setminus KFx$.\n",
    "* To find unknown values $f(\\hat{x})$, we use interpolation. \n",
    "* Interpolation is a type of estimation, a method of constructing (finding) new data points based on the range of a discrete set of known data points. Data points from the original function can be interpolated to produce a simpler function which is still fairly close to the original. \n",
    "* Let  $\\tilde{f}(x)$ be our approximation function.\n",
    "  * the unknown values $f(\\hat{x}) \\approx \\tilde{f}(\\hat{x})$ where  $\\hat{x} \\in uKFx$\n",
    "  * and also satisfied $f(x) = \\tilde{f}(x)$ where $x \\in KFx$ (the  original data points from each measurement will not be manupalated)\n",

    "* Interpolation provides a means of estimating the function at intermediate points, such as $x= 2.5$\n",
    "\n",
    "* There some methods of interpolation, differing in such properties as: accuracy, cost, number of data points needed, and smoothness of the resulting interpolant function. \n",
    "In our case we use Cubic Spline Interpolation. \n",

    "* Cubic spline interpolation is a special case for Spline interpolation that is used very often to avoid the problem of Runge's phenomenon. \n",
    "* This method gives an interpolating polynomial that is smoother and has smaller error than some other interpolating polynomials such as Lagrange polynomial and Newton polynomial.\n",
